 * Returns an object with one `pruned` key indicating the number of members that would be removed in a prune operation. Requires the `KICK_MEMBERS` permission.
 *
 * By default, prune will not remove users with roles. You can optionally include specific roles in your prune by providing the `include_roles` parameter. Any inactive user that has a subset of the provided role(s) will be counted in the prune and users with additional roles will not.
